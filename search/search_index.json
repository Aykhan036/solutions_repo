Theoretical Foundation We begin with the basic equations of motion for a projectile launched at angle \\(\\theta\\) with speed \\(v_0\\) , assuming: No air resistance Constant gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) Launch height = 0 Decomposing Motion Horizontal velocity: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Vertical velocity: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Time of flight ( \\(T\\) ) until it hits the ground: \\[ T = \\frac{2v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled: \\[ R = v_{0x} \\cdot T = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This is the governing equation for range as a function of angle. 2. Analysis of the Range Key Observations Maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) since \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) reaches its peak at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) Symmetry: \\(R(\\theta) = R(90^\\circ - \\theta)\\) Effect of Parameters Initial velocity \\(v_0\\) : Range increases quadratically with \\(v_0\\) Gravity \\(g\\) : Range is inversely proportional to \\(g\\) (lower gravity = farther range) 3. Practical Applications This model can apply to: Sports (e.g., soccer, basketball) \u2013 adjusting launch angles for maximum range Engineering (e.g., missile trajectory, water jets) Astrophysics \u2013 modeling orbits and interplanetary trajectories (with modifications) Beyond Ideal Model Real-world considerations: - Air resistance (drag) - Wind - Non-zero launch height - Uneven terrain These factors require numerical integration and more complex models. 4.
